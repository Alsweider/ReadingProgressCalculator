# Reading Progress Calculator
E-readers often have either virtual page numbers that differ from the printed book or they just display your reading progress in percent. 
Maybe you want to switch to the printed version or you want to log your reading progress on Goodreads but your e-reader doesn't show the real page numbers.
If you want to find out which page you would be reading on in the printed book right now, you can use this console tool.
